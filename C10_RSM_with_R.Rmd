This is the red book - Design and Analysis of Experiments with R

https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExperimentalDesign.html

https://tjmurphy.github.io/jabstb/


daewr package - accompanies the book Design and Analysis of Experiments with R by Lawson (2014) and does not only provide data sets from the book but also some standalone functionality that is not available elsewhere in R, e.g. definitive screening designs.

FrF2 package - exp design for industrial experiments - (Groemping 2014) is the most comprehensive R package for their creation


rsm package - supports sequential optimization with first order and second order response surface models (central composite or Box-Behnken designs), offering optimization approaches like steepest ascent and visualization of the response function for linear model objects. Also, coding for response surface investigations is facilitated.


DoE.wrapper package - enhances design creation from package rsm with the possibilities of automatically choosing the cube portion of central composite designs and of augmenting an existing (fractional) factorial 2-level design with a star portion.

rsurface package - provides rotatable central composite designs for which the user specifies the minimum and maximum of the experimental variables instead of the corner points of the cube.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
## libraries
#install.packages("Vdgraph")

library(daewr)
library(rsm)
library(Vdgraph)
#library(FrF2)
#library(DoE.wrapper)
#library(rsurface)
```

```{r}
data(package="daewr")
```



```{r}
#library(rsm)
rotd <- ccd(3, n0 = c(4,2), alpha = "rotatable",randomize = FALSE)
rotd # the rsm experiment table
# cdd function is from the rsm package

"By choosing the distance from the origin to the axial points (α in coded units) equal to √4F where F is the number of points in
the factorial portion of the design, a CCD will be rotatable."

"The factor columns from the resulting design object rotd are copied into the data frame rotdm and the Vdgraph function from the R
package Vdgraph (Lawson (2013b), Lawson (2012)) is then called to create Myers et al.’s (1992) variance dispersion graph"

rotdm <- rotd[ , 3:5]
#library(Vdgraph)
Vdgraph(rotdm)

"The variance dispersion graph plots the maximum, minimum, and average scaled variance of a predicted value (NV ar(yˆ(x))/σ2) 
as a functionnof the distance from the origin of the design."

"When the design is not rotatable,there will be three distinct lines on the graph. The closer together the lines,
the closer the design is to being rotatable"

```
